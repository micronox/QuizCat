# QuizCat Web

A Next.js rewrite of the QuizCat terminal app, backed by Postgres (Vercel
Postgres / Neon). Single-user, no auth.

Live Railway deployment:
https://quizcat-web-production.up.railway.app

## 1. Set up Postgres

1. In your Vercel project, go to **Storage → Create Database → Postgres**
   (this provisions a Neon-backed Postgres database).
2. Copy the connection string Vercel gives you (it auto-populates
   `POSTGRES_URL` as a project env var). For local development, copy it into
   a `.env.local` file in this directory:

   ```
   POSTGRES_URL="postgres://user:password@host/dbname?sslmode=require"
   ```

## 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## 3. Create the schema

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

This applies `db/schema.sql` (questions, choices, tests, test_questions,
attempts, attempt_answers).

## 4. Seed the question bank

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

This reads `../ccat_full_question_bank_prompt_stimulus.csv` (the same seed
file the Python app uses), validates every row, and upserts questions,
choices, and the 8 sample-exam tests. Safe to re-run.

If your CSV lives somewhere else, pass a path:

```bash
npm run db:seed -- path/to/file.csv
```

## 5. Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

## 6. Question Lab (LLM harness)

Question Lab turns the notebook generation experiment into a governed,
review-only web workflow. The LLM creates a candidate; deterministic
checkpoints validate its schema, single answer, explanation, category,
similarity, safety, export readiness, and arithmetic where applicable.
Failed candidates receive structured feedback for up to two revisions.
Candidates are never written to the production question bank automatically.

Set these server-only variables to unlock it:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"
QUESTION_LAB_ENABLED="true"
QUESTION_LAB_ACCESS_TOKEN="a-long-random-secret"
```

Set `QUESTION_LAB_ACCESS_TOKEN` on public deployments. The API compares it
server-side and also limits each client to three generation requests per five
minutes. Model calls have a 45-second timeout, one retry, and a bounded output.
Keep `QUESTION_LAB_ENABLED=false` until both secrets are configured.

## 7. Images

Question images live in `public/images/`, copied from the Python app's
`images/` directory. They're served directly at `/images/<filename>`.

## 8. Deploy to Railway

The included `railway.toml` builds and starts the Next.js production server.
Deploy `web/` as the service root and provide `POSTGRES_URL`:

```powershell
railway add --service quizcat-web --json
railway variable set 'POSTGRES_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}' --service quizcat-web
railway up web --path-as-root --service quizcat-web --detach
railway domain --service quizcat-web
```

The Postgres schema and seed data must be applied once before the first
deployment, as described in steps 3 and 4.

Current production data contains 400 questions across 8 sample exams.

Always pass `--service quizcat-web` and deploy `web/` with `--path-as-root`.
Deploying the repository root to this service would start the wrong application.

Brand assets live in `public/brand/`. The transparent PNG is used in the web
interface; the JPEG is retained for social previews and export use.

## 9. Deploy to Vercel

1. Push this repo to GitHub (or your git provider of choice).
2. Import the project in Vercel, set the **root directory** to `web/` if
   this lives alongside the Python app.
3. Make sure the Postgres integration from step 1 is attached to the
   project (env vars get injected automatically).
4. After the first deploy, run the migration + seed scripts once against
   the production database — either locally with `POSTGRES_URL` pointed at
   prod, or via `vercel env pull` to fetch the prod connection string into
   `.env.local` temporarily.

## Architecture notes

- `db/schema.sql` — Postgres schema, translated from the original SQLite
  schema in `storage.py`.
- `db/seed.ts` / `db/migrate.ts` — one-off scripts (`tsx`), ported from
  `seed_from_csv` / `create_schema`.
- `lib/db.ts` — shared `pg` connection pool.
- `lib/queries.ts` — data-access layer, ported from `QuizStorage`.
- `lib/questionContent.ts` — question markdown/table formatting, ported from
  `services.py`.
- `app/api/**` — REST endpoints backing the UI (tests, attempts, answers).
- `app/page.tsx`, `app/quiz/[testId]/page.tsx`, `app/stats/page.tsx` — the
  three screens (dashboard, quiz, stats), mirroring `screens.py`.

## Known gaps / follow-ups

- No auth — anyone with the URL can take quizzes and see stats. Fine for
  personal use; add auth before sharing widely.
- The "Abort" button records the attempt as `aborted` server-side but the
  original TUI just discarded it. Adjust `abortQuiz` in
  `components/QuizRunner.tsx` if you'd rather not persist aborted attempts.
